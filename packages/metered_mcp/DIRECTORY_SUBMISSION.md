### One-Line Description
> Sub-35µs in-process AST invariant gate for AI agents. Blocks DROP TABLE, rm -rf, secret exfiltration before syscall. Pay $0.005 per check or subscribe for flat-rate.

---

### Full Description
Bartholomew is a cryptographic execution gateway that evaluates every proposed AI agent tool call *in-process*, in under 35 microseconds, before it reaches the OS.

When your autonomous agent tries to `DROP TABLE`, run `rm -rf /`, or leak an API key through a tool payload, Bartholomew vetoes the action and returns an Ed25519-signed Merkle receipt as proof of prevention — without any network round-trip overhead.

**Metered Billing via L402 / Stripe Agentic Commerce**
- Send a `tools/call` without a payment token → receive a `402 Payment Required` JSON-RPC challenge with a Stripe invoice
- Pay the $0.005 micro-fee → re-send the call with `L402 payment_hash:preimage` in `_meta.Authorization`
- For monthly subscribers: pass `Bearer sk_btp_...` to bypass per-call billing

**Supported Tools**
| Tool | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `execute_database_query` | AST-gates SQL queries, blocks DROP/TRUNCATE/DELETE without WHERE |
| `execute_system_command` | AST-gates shell commands, blocks rm -rf, chmod 777, privilege escalation |
| `btp_guard_eval` | Generic pre-flight evaluation of any agent action with Ed25519 Merkle receipt |
